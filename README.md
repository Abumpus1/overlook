## Project Overview

### Welcome to **Overlook Hotel**!
Overlook is an application that allows a user to view and book hotel rooms. In this application, the user can log in with a username (customer1 - customer50) and a password (overlook2021) and view any bookings that account has made in the past, as well as any active bookings, and the total the user has spend on rooms so far. 

The user can also click the "book now" button on the top right of the dashboard, and be taken to a screen that allows the user to view and book available rooms. On this screen, the user can search for available rooms by date as well as by room type. Once a user clicks on the button to book a room, they will be brought back to the dashboard, which should now have the new booking displayed under the "Active Bookings" section.

Here's the [deploy link!](https://abumpus1.github.io/overlook/)

### Learning Goals and Outcomes
The main goals for this project were to gain further familiarity with fetch API, Webpack, and writing tests. This was a solo educational project with a time frame of one week to complete. My personal goal was to try my best to make a realistic looking site with the data given to me and the expectations of the project spec in mind.


### Future Features
- Impliment a manager log in, that can view all customers and add/remove bookings for customers
